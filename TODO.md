# What should, but have not done

- [ ] Rewrite all maths to a generic form to allow both fast and precise computations with the same codebase.
      Possible tools: `spire` and proper task delegation.
- [ ] Understand whether (1+λ) RLS is suboptimal for 16 <= λ <= 128 or so.
      This includes a small convincing example.
- [ ] If the above is true, attempt at finding the optimal probability distribution.
- [ ] Understand whether non-monotonicity in mutation strength has something in common
      with the fractal picture of drift non-optimality.
